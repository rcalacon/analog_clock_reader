SDSU Applied Computer Vision Semester Project

This project takes images as input and tries to determine the time. This is done using computer vision / machine learning techniques. For the supervised learning phase, a sample set of analog clocks are initially read to determine the time. At this point the times of each clock image is known and provided to the machine.

Other images of analog clocks are then provided to see if the machine can accurately determine their displayed time.
